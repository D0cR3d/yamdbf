YAMDBF is a lightweight Discord Bot framework for rapid bot development using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org),
making it simple to get a bot up and running with minimal effort and configuration.

>Note: Features described here are representative of the state of the master branch. Installing directly from GitHub
is currently preferred due to the proximity to release and dependency issues in the latest stable release.

>Use `npm install --save zajrik/yamdbf` to install from GitHub. This requires `git` to be installed and in your PATH,
and also requires > Node 8.0.0 to run.

>Documentation for the master branch can be found [here](https://yamdbf.js.org/indev).

## Features

- Base commands for control over default settings
- Full control over all base commands via disabling or overloading

- Fine control of command execution per-user/globally via configurable ratelimits

  control over the data passed to your commands
  - Ships with methods for resolving different data types and ensuring  
    certain args/types are passed to commands
- Easy to use storage with support for custom storage providers
  - Ships with a default JSON provider, and other optional providers using Sequelize:
    - Postgres
	- SQLite
- Plugin system
- Full TypeScript support (It's written in it!)
  - Support for decorators for simpler handling of:
	- Event listeners
    - Command metadata
	- Command middleware assignment
